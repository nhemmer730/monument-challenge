        <p>The Pantheon, "[temple] of all the
          gods" is a former Roman temple and, since AD 609, a Catholic church (Basilica Santa Maria ad Martyres or
          Basilica
          of
          St. Mary and the Martyrs) in Rome, Italy. It was built on the site of an earlier temple commissioned by Marcus
          Agrippa
          during the reign of Augustus (27 BC â€“ AD 14), then after that burnt down, the present building was ordered by
          the
          emperor Hadrian and probably dedicated c. AD 126. Its date of construction is uncertain, because Hadrian chose
          not
          to
          inscribe the new temple but rather to retain the inscription of Agrippa's older temple.

          The building is round in plan, except for the portico with large granite Corinthian columns (eight in the
          first
          rank and
          two groups of four behind) under a pediment. A rectangular vestibule links the porch to the rotunda, which is
          under a
          coffered concrete dome, with a central opening (oculus) to the sky. Almost two thousand years after it was
          built,
          the
          Pantheon's dome is still the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome.The height to the oculus and the
          diameter
          of
          the interior circle are the same, 43 metres (142 ft).

          It is one of the best-preserved of all Ancient Roman buildings, in large part because it has been in
          continuous
          use
          throughout its history. Since the 7th century, it has been a church dedicated to St. Mary and the Martyrs
          (Latin:
          Sancta
          Maria ad Martyres), known as "Santa Maria Rotonda". The square in front of the Pantheon is called Piazza della
          Rotonda. The Pantheon is a state property, managed by Italy's Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and
          Tourism
          through the Polo Museale del Lazio. In 2013, it was visited by over six million people.

          The Pantheon's large circular domed cella, with a conventional temple portico front, was unique in Roman
          architecture.
          Nevertheless, it became a standard exemplar when classical styles were revived, and has been copied many times
          by
          later
          architects.
