                <p>The Pantheon (UK: /ˈpænθiən/, US: /-ɒn/;[1] Latin:
                    Pantheum,[nb 1] from Greek Πάνθειον Pantheion, "[temple]
                    of all the
                    gods") is a former Roman temple and, since AD 609, a Catholic church (Basilica Santa Maria ad
                    Martyres
                    or
                    Basilica of
                    St. Mary and the Martyrs) in Rome, Italy. It was built on the site of an earlier temple commissioned
                    by
                    Marcus Agrippa
                    during the reign of Augustus (27 BC – AD 14), then after that burnt down, the present building was
                    ordered
                    by the
                    emperor Hadrian and probably dedicated c. AD 126. Its date of construction is uncertain, because
                    Hadrian
                    chose not to
                    inscribe the new temple but rather to retain the inscription of Agrippa's older temple.[2]

                    The building is round in plan, except for the portico with large granite Corinthian columns (eight
                    in
                    the
                    first rank and
                    two groups of four behind) under a pediment. A rectangular vestibule links the porch to the rotunda,
                    which
                    is under a
                    coffered concrete dome, with a central opening (oculus) to the sky. Almost two thousand years after
                    it
                    was
                    built, the
                    Pantheon's dome is still the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome.[3] The height to the oculus
                    and
                    the
                    diameter of
                    the interior circle are the same, 43 metres (142 ft).[4]</p>
